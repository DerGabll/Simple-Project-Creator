# Simple Project Creator


## What it does:

It makes a folder where you can choose which files you want to add to it in a directory set by you. So if you want to make multiple projects you can make them easily in the same path and organized :D

## How to use:
  
Copy both main.py and conf.txt into the same directory. Then, in the config file, change the path after 'defaultPath=' to be where you make your projects. 
Then install the modules for the project in the requirenments.txt using 'pip install -r requirenments.txt'. Now you can start using the app by starting the python file.
